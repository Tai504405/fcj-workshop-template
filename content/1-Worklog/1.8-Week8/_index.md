### Focus & Objectives of Week 8:

- Finalize the overall architecture model for the final project to prepare for the actual deployment phase.
- Clearly decompose the main components of the system including CI/CD, containerization, application runtime, database, backup, and monitoring.
- Align on the project deployment direction on AWS utilizing ECS Fargate, RDS, CloudWatch, and related services.

### Key Accomplishments - Week 8:

- Finalized the overall architecture model for the final project on AWS:
  - Defined the **Build & Containerization Flow** block with GitHub, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, ECR, and Artifact Bucket.
  - Defined the **Deployment** block with VPC, Internet Gateway, Public Subnet, Private Subnet, ECS Cluster, ECS Fargate, Frontend, Backend, internet-facing ALB, and internal ALB.
  - Defined the **Database / Recovery & Backup** block with Amazon RDS for MySQL, RDS Snapshot, and Backup Bucket.
  - Defined the **Monitoring & Observability** block with CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Metrics, CloudWatch, SNS, and Email/SMS notifications.
- Agreed on the expected deployment workflow for the project:
  - Source code is managed on GitHub.
  - The pipeline handles building, artifact storage, and pushing container images to Amazon ECR.
  - The application is planned to run on ECS Fargate under a decoupled Frontend and Backend model.
  - The backend connects to RDS for MySQL in a private subnet.
- Clarified the backup and monitoring approach for the system before entering the hands-on implementation phase:
  - Backup is handled through RDS Snapshots and export to a backup bucket.
  - Logging, metrics, and alerting are monitored through CloudWatch and SNS.
- Prepared the design foundation for the team to move into the final project implementation stage in the following weeks.
