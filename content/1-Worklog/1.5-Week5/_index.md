### Key Accomplishments - Week 5:

- Completed Module 5 and mastered all knowledge about AWS security:
  - Shared Responsibility Model: Security of the Cloud vs Security in the Cloud.
  - IAM: Root Account best practices, User/Group/Policy (JSON, Explicit Deny, 3 policy types), IAM Role (Assume Role, least privilege), IAM for AWS services.
  - Amazon Cognito: User Pool/Identity Pool, social login, fine-grained access control.
  - AWS Organizations: manage multiple accounts, OU, Consolidated Billing, SCP.
  - AWS Identity Center: SSO, Permission Sets, portal.
  - AWS KMS: Master Key/Data Key, encrypt/decrypt, FIPS 140-2 level 2.
  - AWS Security Hub: continuous security checks, AWS/PCI DSS standards.
- Understood and distinguished responsibility between AWS and customers by service type.
- Completed all hands-on labs per Module 05-08 about AWS security:
  - **Lab44**: IAM Role & Condition (create User/Group as EC2/RDS admins, create Role with IP/time restrictions).
  - **Lab48**: Grant app access to AWS services with IAM Role (no hard-code access keys).
  - **Lab30**: Limit user permissions with IAM Permission Boundary (limit maximum permissions, reduce privilege escalation gaps).
  - **Lab27**: Manage resources with Tag & Resource Groups (tag resources, use Resource Group to manage multiple resources at once).
  - **Lab28**: Manage EC2 access with Resource Tag via AWS IAM (apply least privilege with tag-based policy and role).
  - **Lab18**: Getting started with AWS Security Hub (aggregate security alerts, check compliance per AWS/PCI DSS standards).
  - **Lab12**: Use AWS IAM Identity Center for strong identity management (set up SSO for multiple AWS accounts, assign permissions by group/team, least privilege).
  - **Lab33**: Introduction to AWS Key Management Service (KMS) (create Symmetric/Asymmetric CMK, set key policy, integrate with CloudTrail for logging).
  - **Lab22**: Optimize EC2 costs with Lambda (automatically start/stop instances with Lambda, learn about Saving Plan).
